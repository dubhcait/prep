# Product Owner guide

## General

**Founders and Coders** is a UK-based nonprofit
Opening access to the digital economy through sharing our model of peer-led learning and cooperative work

**The graduate Programme**
A pair of graduates complete three **Tech for Better** projects. For each project, the London team will be joined remotely by a pair of Palestinian developers. 

This programme Is funded by Intersticia. The concept of Intersticia has always been based on dynamism and change, operating within the interstice that exists between technology, culture and society.  But also between the potential of ideas and reality of execution.  Our goal is to work with people and their ability to imagination.


## The Design process

![](https://i.imgur.com/n54yqwl.png)

Phase 1 & 2 = Discovery workshop

Phase 3 & 4 = Exploration workshop

Phase 5 = Design sprint & User testing of the prototype 

Phase 6 = Sprint Planning workshop


## What is a prototype?
A prototype is a quasi-realistic representation (fancy picture) of what you are building that can be acted with and tested on users in order to help validate your design.

They are useful for a number of reasons:

- Help identify usability issues before going to code
- Get early user feedback from user research
- Observe how users want to interact with your design
- Faster to create than fully coded solutions (front and back end)


## User Research 

User research prevents our own assumptions from taking over and instead keeps our focus on the actual user.


Possible Methods

### Which methods should I choose?
By using a combination of research methods you are more likely to get a complete picture of who your users are and how you can help them. For example, an online survey may help you to answer a question such as “how many people currently use a fitness app”? But this does not tell you why they use a fitness app. Conducting an in-depth interview could then reveal what motivates people to use a fitness app.

### Use a structured approach
Following a structured approach to user research ensures consistency, clearly defines objectives and allows for effective use of research findings.

- Set clear objectives for your research
- Devise a hypothesis based on your objectives
- Conduct your research
- Analyse the findings in relation to your hypothesis
- Implement changes

Finally, remember to repeat the process. Once you have tested one iteration of a design and made changes to it, test it again to see if you have addressed the issues highlighted by participants during the initial testing.


### What is a user interview?
A user interview is a common user research technique used typically to get qualitative information from either existing or potential users.

It is typically covers any range of topics from:

The person’s background
Their occupation
Their use of technology
Their goals
Their motivations
Their pain points

These all add vital meat on the bone to any personas you design and help you understand your potential and existing users.


**Let the person know why you are doing the interview** – Many people may be wary about a stranger coming and asking them lots of personal questions. Before you jump in give them an overview of what you are trying to accomplish and most importantly let them know there are no wrong answers. Also let them know that any feedback will be kept anonymous.

**Don’t ask any leading questions** – Rather than asking ‘How often do you use Facebook?’, ask ‘Do you use any social networks?’. Not only does this give you opportunities to ask follow up questions but it can uncover insights that you may have forgotten to ask about.

**Use the script as a guide not a bible** – The script should help lead the conversation in the right direction but it should not be stuck to too rigidly. Be prepared to go a little off piste if the conversation is heading in an interesting direction. Just make sure to cover all the areas you need to.

**Keep it to 30 min**– A fairly simple tip but an important one. Most people will have trouble staying focussed longer than this so if you are running out of time cherry pick the most important questions.

**Leave time between interviews** – A whole day of user interviews can be exhausting, particularly towards the end. Give yourself a half hour buffer between them to allow for any over run, give you time to finish up your notes and to have a bit of a break.

**How do you run the user interview?**
If you are doing it solo then you have a slightly tougher task in that you need to record your findings as well as run the interview. 
 

Some quick tips for during the interview are:

**Keep it on track** – As previously mentioned, it’s ok to go a little bit off script as long as it’s adding value to your research but if it’s a complete tangent get the interviewee focussed again by saying something like “That’s really interesting, but what I really wanted to ask about was X”
**Try not to bury your head in your notes** – Easier when there are two of you, but even if it’s you on your own try to maintain eye contact where possible and don’t spent the entire time writing.
